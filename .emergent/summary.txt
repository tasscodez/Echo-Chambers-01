The previous AI engineer initiated work on a full-stack React/FastAPI web application. However, the user's primary goal was to build Echo Chambers, a highly immersive and personalized 3D game inspired by emotionally resonant art. Initially, the AI identified a significant mismatch between the existing web app and the game requirements. After clarifying user priorities for AI-driven development and persistent progress, the AI committed to building the entire game as a web-based 3D experience using the existing backend for data. The user subsequently provided extensive, detailed features, including advanced player movement (flying, swimming), complex UI menus, mini-games, crafting, spells, and a dream world. The AI acknowledged this comprehensive vision and began structuring the frontend with Three.js components and updating the backend to support the game's systems. The work is now focused on setting up the core game architecture and UI.

The user initially expressed a need for emotionally cathartic, interactive AI experiences mirroring the depth of games like Tell Me Why or Inside. This evolved into a vision for a personalized 3D game titled Echo Chambers. Key requirements include a playable 3D world with a customizable player character and an AI companion named Echo, powered by GPT-4, offering emotional mirroring and guidance. The setting is a Maleficent-style castle and misty outdoor wilderness. Core gameplay involves dialogue with Echo, journaling, mood-shifting environments, and dynamic music. Advanced mechanics include diverse player movement (flying, swimming), discoverable mini-games, object collection, crafting, and a spell system. A comprehensive Quick Menu with tabs for settings, a world map, inventory, journal, conversation history, notes, and a spellbook is required. Players can sleep to enter a dream realm with unique interactions. The game must support persistent progress saving and be accessible via web, with a preference for downloadable Mac/Windows versions.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python backend framework for API endpoints.
- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for persistent data storage.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript 3D library for rendering game environments.
- **React Three Fiber/Drei**: React renderers for Three.js.
- **Zustand**: State management library for React.
- **GPT-4 API**: Integration for the AI companion's intelligence.
- **Web Audio API**: For dynamic, mood-based music system.
- **Yarn**: Package manager for frontend dependencies.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project began as a full-stack web application, now being transformed into a 3D web-based game.



**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Rewritten to incorporate game-specific API endpoints for GPT-4 integration, save data, and potentially other game state management. It retains existing database and CORS setup.
- : Rewritten to become the main entry point for the 3D game, integrating the Three.js canvas and core game components.
- : Likely modified to ensure proper canvas sizing and general game UI styling.
- New  and  directories: These house all the modular React components necessary for building the 3D world, player controls, AI companion, UI, and various menu tabs, reflecting a structured approach to the complex game requirements.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement advanced player movement (crouching, running, walking, grabbing/interacting, climbing, swimming, flying).
- Develop exploration mechanics (clearing vines, underwater caves).
- Integrate discoverable mini-games and hidden objects/rewards.
- Implement the comprehensive Quick Menu's full functionality for all tabs (settings, world map, inventory, journal, conversations, notes, spellbook).
- Build the crafting system using gathered materials and spell-created items.
- Develop the spell system based on milestones and environmental effects.
- Create the Dream Realm accessible through sleep, with mood-based visuals and unseen Echo communication.
- Implement room customization/decoration within the castle.
- Set up the full save/load progress system.
- Integrate the dynamic music system with provided tracks.
- Implement mirror mechanics.
- Incorporate literal decision trees.

**Core Game Components**: The main  and  files have been updated to initiate the 3D game. Key components like , , , , and  have been created to lay the foundation for the game's rendering, input, and overall state.
**3D World & Characters**:  is established for the environment,  for the user's 3D model (the provided .fbx file), and  for the AI companion's placeholder model.
**UI & Menu System**: Core UI overlay (), the main quick menu (), and the chat interface () have been created. Furthermore, the individual tabs for the Quick Menu—, , , , , , and —have all been created, laying out the structural elements for the extensive UI requirements.
**Next Immediate Step**: The AI has just stated its intention to install a physics engine, indicating the next crucial step in enabling realistic 3D world interactions.
